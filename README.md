Unity3D version 5 Personal Edition game launcher with your own professional splash screen

The purpose of this git repositary is, to force Unity Technologies rebranding the ridiculous splash screen from Personal Edition to something else; like, Powered by Unity. Personal Edition sounds like the games are developed with a non-commercial (personal) evaluation version.

This game launcher will not remove the mandatory Unity3D splash screen, however, the way Unity3D coded the splash screen gives us an advantage not having to show it without actually removing it.

The basics are like this:

The game launcher will execute the Unity3D game minimized. The startup scene (usually your Unity3D game menu) will have a script attached which is included here, to maximize the game window. The Unity splash screen does not allow any coding, so we use this trick. The result will be that when the Unity splash screen is finished the game menu will show up giving the impression that there was no Unity3D Personal Edition splash screen.

The structure is: Game folder, game launcher, sub folder for Unity game. Everything is customizable.

Please share this with your friends and promote it everywhere. Itâ€™s free software under public domain license and you never will have to pay for it here on github. If you got this game launcher from somewhere else having to pay money for it then I take no responsibility for it that you get your money back, instead inform your friends that this software is free available here, but you are allowed to charge money for it, of cause according to the PD-license.

Setup guide:

Your Unity game has a unique name, so you need to change the code inside Visual Studio to reflect that. Look for the following line of code and change it:

ExternalProcess.StartInfo.FileName = (@"Game\Unity.exe"); // Unity.exe = game name

change Unity.exe to whatever your game name is.

You may also add buttons to the game launcher like Quit and start game etc.. You can do this in the designer by also adding a different picture and URL links and what not.

Have fun with a more professional look and feel for your Unity games.
